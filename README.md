# rte-www
Repository to hold the documentation (generated from texinfo) for acplt/rte.

## releases
Here you'll find the latest 10 releases (of the 10 latest building commits) for linux (32 and 64 bit), windows 32 and Raspberry Pi.
Don't be scared by the files sizes. The archives carry lots of Development data with them. If you are just interested in the runtime, you only need the *system/sysbin*, *system/syslibs*, *system/addonlibs*, *system/systools* and *servers* folders on your target system. 
A Release list can be found here: [Releases](http://acplt.github.io/rte-www/releases/)
